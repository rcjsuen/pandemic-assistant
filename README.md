# Pandemic Assistant

Pandemic Assistant is a tool optimized solely for phones and tablets for monitoring the state of the Pandemic board game. The application is available [online](https://rcjsuen.github.io/pandemic-assistant/). After you open the link, fill in the appropriate setup information and use the "Start" button to begin!

## Features
### Player Deck

Pandemic Assistant monitors your player deck given the initial state of the game (the number of players, epidemic cards, and event cards in the deck) to give a prediction as to when to start expecting an epidemic card to be drawn.

### Infection Deck
Pandemic Assistant will group your infection cards so that you can tell where something is.

For example, if you perform the Intensify step and put ten cards on top and later perform Intensify again to put five cards on top, Pandemic Asisstant will remember the "original subset" that has not been drawn from the first ten cards. This grouping helps you predict what may be drawn after five cards have been drawn
